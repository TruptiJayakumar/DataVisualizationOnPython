# DataVisualizationOnPython
## Importing train data from Kaggle as a csv to conduct analysis
### Visulaizing each class of passengers based on gender and age
### Creating an additional coliumn for person ( male, female and child) and also Cabin information
### Finding out answers to interesting questions as follows:
*Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)*
*What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?*
*Where did the passengers come from?*
*Who was alone and who was with family?*
### We then visualize to find out answers to the question:
*What factors helped someone survive the sinking?*
